## Our Contributions

What we did:

- Benchmark on different datasets, both OOD and [CD](tda_cd_benchmark.ipynb)
with failure cases on CIFAR-10-C (non-iid data stream) ![CD_benchmark](docs/CD_benchmark.png)
- We evaluated [how the performance changed w.r.t. changing hyperparameters](tda_runner_experiments.py) and the orders of data presented considering budget-aware constraints ![positive_hyperparams](docs/positive_hyperparams.png)

- We tried to mitigate the issues adding a [Waiting List](tda_runner_with_waiting.py) to the model, which improved performance on ImageNet but didnâ€™t help on more challenging dataset like as CIFAR10-C ![waiting list](docs/waiting_list.png)
